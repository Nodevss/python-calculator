github is acting really weird, so theres gonna be some weird instructions if you wanna see this

first, you will need to have python installed, which you can get [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). once done, you'll need to go inside the pythonproject folder and create a new folder there named `dist`. your pythonproject folder should look like this:

then, head to the releases tab on the repository, it should be somewhere on the right, under description. there you'll find the `main.py` file, download that.

you can then put it in your dist folder, and then run it, then you should be able to get the caculator working :>
